# Intro

This is Fang Yuan from China! A Fresh Postgrad with intensive Enthusiasm to apply Statistics and AI to businesses and societies. I love to embrace fresh things and infuse myself into new environments. I am armed with both structured and detail-oriented thinking, which are well proved in my past interning experiences.

Plus, I spent more than 1 year to study Fashion Design!ðŸ‘€
