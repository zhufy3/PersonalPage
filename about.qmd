I thrive on embracing new challenges and immersing myself in diverse environments. My approach is characterized by a blend of structured thinking and meticulous attention to detail, qualities that have been reinforced through my past internships.

Interestingly, I also dedicated over a year to exploring the realm of Fashion Design!ðŸ‘€
